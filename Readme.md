A common api architecture and design language for all machine learning related projects with library support in Python ( with tensorflow(keras) and pytorch framework support ) and C++.
The end goal for the project is to create a design framework for machine learning projects to provide uniformity in the vastly non-uniform world of machine learning research and development projects.
The ProjectAIle provides a common project structure, useful functionality through a standard api and a guideline for taking any product from research to production.
After working on several machine learning projects and facing several difficulties in going from a raw research and experimentation based development to production based development, i've constantly optimized my workflow and development process as well as the code organization structure and have created techniques and methods that can be utilized to reduce the boiler plate stuff and takes out the hassle of re-writing or modifying several mundane tasks that can slow down the speed of development.
Although everyone have their own style of development and their own way of organizing their code, through ProjectAIle, i plan to provide a common checklist or pipeline or workflow which is essentially common in every machine learning project and can be easily modified by anyone or extended upon to customize their workflow.
